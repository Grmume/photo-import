# photo-import
Collection of scripts for the import and storage of photos

These scripts are used to import photos from a connected camera and organize them in a archive.
There are plenty of solutions for this process, but I could not find one which lets me store my pictures in an archive by date
and still offer a way to browse pictures by event in the file explorer.

The scripts are meant to be used in conjunction with a Seafile server to allow remote storage of the pictures on a NAS (which can also perform backups on a regulare basis)

In the future it should be possible for multiple people to collaborate on events and easily share pictures (using the seafile server)
